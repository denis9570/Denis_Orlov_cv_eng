### Motivation letter
----------------
Hello, my friends recommended me to apply to your company.
they told me that this is good place where I can learn new stuff from experienced geeks.
I use a computer at an almost perfect level. I help my friends fix notebooks, reinstall windows, and more on the little things. I can understand any program, about problems, it depends on its complexity, if the program does not start or freezes, then it can be easily dealt with, but if a problem is about for example disk remapping, this is already more difficult, but I hope to master it in the future.

I know how to work with multimeter 

I can install any program, I also reinstalled win 10 more than once, and I worked with linux on one task at the university. I study fast, always open to new knowledge.
