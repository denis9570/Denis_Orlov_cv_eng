 - C++ 
  
	is my first language, from that I learned all the basics of programming starting
	from creating variables and ending with working with memory. Many practical tasks were completed, but the most interesting
	was a course work, it was a database of games, that was
	the first experience of creating a base, I used all the knowledge I had received before.
	I remember such a problem that there was a line of code that was used several times in the program, and
	it had 30 lines of code, I decided to put this line in a separate function and when it will be needed
	then call it through a function. It was interesting and at the same time difficult. But learning something new
	always a pleasure

- Bash

	Probably the most interesting course that was in the university, each lesson was more interesting than
	previous, our teacher 
	<a    href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%93%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%86,_%D0%9D%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B9_%D0%9B%D0%B5%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87">Gudanets, Nikolai Leonardovich</a> was very cool, he talked a lot
	about the advantages of Linux, and how much he does not like windows.
	
	There was an interesting task from the topic "Shell Initialization Files and environment variables on UNIX / Linux"
	the goal was to understand how to properly debug shell files
	My task was to change the configuration files so that in the end of session the following window is displayed

	Goodbye, UserName!
	You worked HH hours, MM minutes, SS seconds

	the goal of the work was to consolidate skills in using elementary commands and utilities of the Linux OS
	
 - Embedded Electronic Devices and Programming
 
 	In addition to common programming, we also had Electronics at the university.
	In the Atmel studio program, we programmed the input / output ports.
	In the final exam I make a program that controls the LEDs. For example: in the beggining working only
	LED 1 and LED 3. After pressing the SW2 button, these LEDs turn off, but turn on
	LED2.
 	
 
 - Haskell
 
	a pure functional language. There are no while loops or for loops, instead of it we used recursions,
	The idea of recursion is extremely simple: If we need to repeat the calculation performed by a certain function, we must apply
	this function within itself. And you get a loop.

	Writing a calculator in this language was something new
