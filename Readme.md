### Motivation letter
----------------
Hello, my friends recommended me to apply to your company.
They told me that this is good place where I can learn new stuff from experienced geeks.
I use a computer at an almost perfect level. I help my friends fix notebooks, reinstall windows, and more on the little things. I can understand any program. 
About technical problem, if the program does not start or freezes, then it can be easily dealt with, but if a problem is about disk remapping, this is more difficult, but I hope to master it in the future.
I'm ok with working overtime if needed.

I know how to work with multimeter. 

I worked with linux on one task at the university. I always open to new knowledge.

  is my first language, from that I learned all the basics of programming starting
from creating variables and ending with working with memory. Many practical tasks were completed, but the most interesting
was a course work, it was a database of games, that was
the first experience of creating a base, I used all the knowledge I had received before.
I remember such a problem that there was a line of code that was used several times in the program, and
it had 30 lines of code, I decided to put this line in a separate function and when it will be needed
then call it through a function. It was interesting and at the same time difficult. But learning something new
always a pleasure

- Bash

Probably the most interesting thing that was in the university, each lesson was more interesting than
previous, our teacher <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%93%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%86,_%D0%9D%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B9_%D0%9B%D0%B5%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87">Gudanets, Nikolai Leonardovich</a> was very cool, he talked a lot
about the advantages of Linux, and how much he does not like windows.
 
 
 - Haskell
 
a pure functional language. There are no while loops or for loops, instead of it we used recursions,
The idea of recursion is extremely simple: If we need to repeat the calculation performed by a certain function, we must apply
this function within itself. And you get a loop.

Writing a calculator in this language was something new

- R

The language used for statistical data processing and graphics

for me personally, it was extremely hard, because here was my “favorite” Statistics, which was three semesters at the university
and they were all under different names: "Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics",
"Methods of Computer Processing of Statistical Data", "Numerical Methods in Computer Calculations". With these lectures
I went through fire and water and I'm glad that they ended.
